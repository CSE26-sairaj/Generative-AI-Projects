- JavaScript algorithm implementation
- User experience design
- Responsive web development

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Any modern web browser
- No additional installations required!

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ultimate-tic-tac-toe.git

   ```

4. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Choose Game Mode**: Select Single Player (vs AI) or Multiplayer
2. **Select Difficulty**: For AI games, choose Easy, Medium, or Hard
3. **Pick Your Symbol**: Choose from preset symbols or create a custom one
4. **Start Playing**: Click on the grid to make your moves
5. **Win Condition**: Get three of your symbols in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)

## 🤖 AI Strategy

The AI implements different strategies based on difficulty:

- **Easy**: Random moves with basic game awareness
- **Medium**: 70% strategic moves, 30% random for unpredictability
- **Hard**: Full strategic play using:
  - Win detection and execution
  - Block opponent wins
  - Center and corner prioritization
  - Optimal move selection

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Modern Aesthetics**: Clean, contemporary design with subtle animations
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface requiring no learning curve
- **Responsive**: Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Accessible**: High contrast ratios and semantic HTML structure

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements and features to add:

- [ ] Online multiplayer functionality
- [ ] Tournament mode with brackets
- [ ] Sound effects and music
- [ ] Themes and color customization
- [ ] Game statistics persistence
- [ ] Achievement system
